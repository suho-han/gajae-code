Inspects, waits, or cancels async jobs.

Background job results are delivered automatically when complete. Jobs that back task subagents should be controlled via the `subagent` tool when it is available; use `job` for non-subagent jobs (async bash, monitors) and as a compatibility fallback. Running job output stays quiet by default to avoid flooding the conversation; use `tail` when you explicitly want to show/reopen retained output. Reach for this tool only when you need to inspect or intervene.

In the interactive TUI, a running foreground command can be folded into a background job by pressing the fold chord twice (default `Alt+Shift+B`, plus `Cmd+B` on macOS; remappable via `app.tool.backgroundFold`), or automatically when the user sends a steer after the command has run for at least 2 seconds (with `busyPromptMode=steer` (`toolInterruptPolicy` is not a gate)). This covers managed non-PTY bash, editor/ACP client-terminal commands, and PTY-mode commands. A folded job keeps its original deadline, is never killed or restarted by folding, and its result wakes a later turn automatically; a folded PTY continues output-only and no longer accepts input. A `job` await also folds after the same 2-second grace window when a steer arrives, returning immediately with the still-running job id(s) while those jobs keep their original deadlines and wake a later turn with their results. Job listings expose `foldReason` (`steer`, `chord`, `timer`, or `sdk_control`) beside `backgrounded` so you can tell why a job left the foreground. `task`/`subagent` waits are not foldable. Raw shell `Ctrl+Z`/`bg` is not the supported path inside GJC because it bypasses job ownership and output-routing contracts.

# Operations

## `list: true`
Use to inspect what's running.

## `tail: [id, …]`
Show the retained output buffer for one or more background jobs without waiting.
- Use this to reopen/tail a backgrounded long-running bash/tool output after folding it away.
- Output is bounded by the manager retention window; stale cursors may report that only the retained tail is available.
- Prefer `tail` over polling when you only need to peek at progress, so the conversation can continue without flooding the TUI.

## `poll: [id, …]`
Block until the specified jobs finish or the wait window (~30 s, not configurable) elapses.
- Use when you are genuinely blocked on a result and have no other work to do.
- Returns the current snapshot when the timer elapses; running jobs remain running.
- Completed jobs include their final output in the returned snapshot.

## `cancel: [id, …]`
Stop running jobs.
- Use when a job is stalled, hung, or no longer needed.
- Returns immediately after cancelling.
