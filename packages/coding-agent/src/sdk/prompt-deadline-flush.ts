/**
 * Worktree durability for a prompt retired by its deadline (#5583).
 *
 * A raised `sdk.promptDeadlineMs` makes the crash rarer, never impossible: the
 * hard `sdk.promptMaxRuntimeMs` cap still fires on a long run, and the session
 * is then torn down with whatever the agent already edited still uncommitted.
 * Field reports lost ~25 minutes of finished work across 37 dirty files that
 * way. Persist that work as a WIP commit in the agent's own worktree before
 * teardown so the next run resumes from a commit instead of re-reasoning.
 *
 * Strictly best effort AND strictly bounded. Every failure — including an abort —
 * is logged and swallowed: the prompt still fails with `prompt_deadline_exceeded`
 * and teardown still happens, because the deadline outcome must never depend on
 * git. Every git call that accepts a signal gets one, so a blocking lock or a
 * hanging plumbing command is killed rather than waited on.
 *
 * ── Isolated index, plumbing commit, compare-and-swap ref move (#5623 round 4)
 *
 * The autosave never opens the user's real `.git/index` for writing and never
 * runs a repository hook:
 *
 *   1. everything is staged into a throwaway index inside the worktree's own git
 *      dir (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`), seeded from the HEAD captured before staging;
 *   2. the commit is built with plumbing — `write-tree` then `commit-tree` — so
 *      `pre-commit`/`commit-msg` cannot execute during teardown;
 *   3. the ref moves with a compare-and-swap against that captured HEAD, so the
 *      one mutation that can outlive teardown is conditional: an abandoned flush
 *      that wakes up late finds HEAD moved and does nothing. `withRepoLock`
 *      awaits its predecessor BEFORE honouring the signal, so this really does
 *      happen — the abort alone cannot prevent it;
 *   4. the real index is adopted only after that swap succeeds, so a successful
 *      autosave leaves `git status` clean instead of a phantom reverse diff.
 *
 * Every failing and aborted path therefore just unlinks the temp index. There is
 * no rollback left to get wrong, and index-only state the user set — intent-to-add,
 * skip-worktree/assume-unchanged, sparse-index, index extensions — survives byte
 * for byte because the file was never written.
 *
 * ── Ownership
 *
 * Staging the whole dirty worktree (`git add -A`, untracked files included) is
 * the point: the work being saved is whatever the agent touched, and narrowing
 * it would strand exactly the files this exists for. What makes that safe is
 * WHERE it runs. `sdk.flushWorktreeOnDeadline` still defaults to on, but the
 * implicit default applies only in a LINKED worktree (`gitDir !== commonDir`) —
 * what agent/paseo sessions run in, and the #5583 field report. In the user's
 * primary checkout an autosave needs an explicit opt-in.
