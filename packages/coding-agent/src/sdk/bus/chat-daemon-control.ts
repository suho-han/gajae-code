/**
 * Operational generations of the Discord/Slack daemon lifecycle contracts.
 * These are intentionally separate from per-session endpoint generations.
 * Generation 6 carries the retained managed filesystem authority boundary.
 * Generation 7 restores macOS daemon signaling (kill(2) with a start-time
 * incarnation recheck) so a live/hung owner can be replaced without an external
 * `kill -9`. Generation 8 adopts Windows expected-identity ACL verification and
 * repair for shared native authority. Generation 9 refreshes the shared native
 * authority declaration contract with bounded frame-delivery acknowledgement.
 * Generation 11 accepts typed retained exact-unlink cleanup authority — a
 * concrete detached quarantine plus a proven-absent canonical lock pathname —
 * when deleting an observed owner-lock lease. Generation 12 refreshes retained
 * native path and process authority semantics. Generation 13 rejects special
 * files before retained native authority opens. Generation 14 reloads shared
 * chat daemons after notification configuration parsing changes. Generation 15
 * applies the current notification configuration directly when starting chat
 * daemon transports. Generation 16 applies Telegram sound-policy configuration
 * through shared notification parsing. Generation 17 bound managed-session
 * replacement to exact native filesystem authority; generation 18 retired that
 * binding, and generation 19 binds exact cleanup to parent/link-count authority
 * while also adding durable provider-intent admission without changing lifecycle
 * behavior. Generation 20 discovers isolated chat-only session endpoints when
 * Telegram identity ownership is blocked. Discord generation 21 applies rustfmt
 * and clippy-equivalent cleanup to the pi-shell process-tree authority (#3682).
 * Discord generation 22 / slack generation 21 refreshes retained cleanup
 * semantics; discord generation 23 / slack generation 22 hardens exact Bash
 * process-tree ownership shared by chat daemon cleanup.
 * Discord generation 24 / slack generation 23 apply provider-completeness and
 * effective-enable admission to chat daemon lifecycle controls. Discord
 * generation 25 / slack generation 24 apply identity-bound exact replacement
 * cleanup shared by managed-session and daemon filesystem authority. Discord
 * generation 26 / slack generation 25 add the in-place operator command channel:
 * an owner serves per-request commands inside its own serving loop and answers
 * them against an exact owner tuple, so an owner at an earlier generation may
 * not serve or answer a request captured against this contract. Discord
 * generation 27 / slack generation 26 move shared exact unlink and process-
 * incarnation authority behind lazy native bindings. Discord generation 28 /
 * slack generation 27 dial attached-session clients on the long-lived session
 * reconnect budget, so an owner at an earlier generation gives up reconnecting
 * before the host heartbeat TTL expires and permanently loses its attachment. Discord
 * generation 29 / slack generation 28 advance the replay cursor only after a frame is
 * published, so an owner at an earlier generation acknowledges an event before delivering
 * it and loses that event for good the first time a surface refuses it. Discord generation 30 /
 * slack generation 29 move lifecycle and attachment authority into SDK core; generation 30 also
 * isolates per-session Router attachment failures so one stale endpoint cannot block healthy sessions.
 * Discord generation 31 bounds one REST operation across response parsing and multi-request flows.
 * Slack generation 30 bounds shutdown, tracks outbound work, and fences late effect commits.
 * Slack generation 31 fences late post admission and tracks close-marker shutdown work.
 * Slack generation 32 bounds provider teardown and preserves close markers after Router revocation.
 * Slack generation 33 bounds lifecycle predecessors under the shutdown deadline.
 * Slack generation 34 CAS-fences cleanup mapping commits against successors.
 * Slack generation 35 identity-fences detached startup cleanup from restarted daemon state.
 * Slack generation 36 retains stop ownership for every detached lifecycle generation.
 * Discord generation 32 / Slack generation 37 bind cleanup to the removed attachment generation.
 * Discord generation 33 / Slack generation 38 identity-fence cleanup callbacks on exact attachments.
 * Discord generation 34 / Slack generation 39 clear stale attachment identity before provider reassignment.
 * Discord generation 35 / Slack generation 40 capture provider ownership before cleanup awaits.
 * Discord generation 36 / Slack generation 41 drain prior cleanup before provider restart.
 * Discord generation 37 / Slack generation 42 serialize successor attachment visibility after cleanup.
 * Discord generation 38 / Slack generation 43 hold successor frames behind cleanup settlement.
 * Discord generation 39 / Slack generation 44 recover durable cleanup before attachment publication.
 * Slack generation 45 persists exact pending cleanup intent through recovery.
 * Discord generation 40 bounds provider lifecycle joins before Router revocation.
 * Discord generation 41 / Slack generation 46 revoke Router authority despite provider shutdown failure.
 * Discord generation 42 / Slack generation 47 retain daemon objects across restart to preserve detached lifecycle fences.
 * Discord generation 43 / Slack generation 48 fence Router attachment publication and Broker-adopted endpoint authority.
 * Discord generation 44 / Slack generation 49 retain provider shutdown tails and rejected lifecycle errors so no successor transport starts before ownership settles.
 * Discord generation 45 / Slack generation 50 clean predecessor presentation authority before exact Router replacement and reject post-stop Discord callbacks.
 * Discord generation 46 / Slack generation 51 establish replay barriers before reconnect awaits, distinguish replacement from terminal cleanup, and await lifecycle-fenced Discord inbound work.
 * Discord generation 47 / Slack generation 52 preserve presentation continuity across replacement while exact opaque authority fences stale work.
 * Discord generation 48 / Slack generation 53 allow exact publication-time requests without reconciliation deadlock.
 * Discord generation 49 / Slack generation 54 revalidate endpoint authority before exact publication-time requests.
 * Discord generation 50 / Slack generation 55 terminalize predecessor routes only for a changed same-generation endpoint incarnation.
 * Slack generation 56 clears predecessor inbound receipts before same-generation successor publication.
 * Discord generation 51 / Slack generation 57 persist restart-stable Router endpoint-incarnation authority in provider mappings.
 * Discord generation 52 / Slack generation 58 classify reconnect-time endpoint changes before provider retirement.
 * Discord generation 53 / Slack generation 59 serialize successor attach behind predecessor provider retirement.
 * Discord generation 54 / Slack generation 60 version-fence attaches already in flight when retirement begins.
 * Discord generation 55 / Slack generation 61 fence durable inbound work by exact attachment identity.
 * Discord generation 56 / Slack generation 62 fence durable provider-post and thread-effect recovery by attachment identity.
 * Discord generation 57 removes missing-authority wildcard behavior from durable binding checks.
 * Discord generation 58 preserves exact authority through unarchive replacement fallback.
 * Discord generation 59 / Slack generation 63 derive attachment authority ids from one Router function so persisted provider bindings and live attachments cannot drift apart.
 * Discord generation 62 / Slack generation 65 fence the Windows process-incarnation
 * authority change (#4362): the native binding fallback no longer spawns powershell.exe.
 * Discord generation 63 / Slack generation 66 retain the shared ownership fence
 * unless a zero-signal process probe returns ESRCH. EPERM and unknown failures are
 * indeterminate, so earlier owners must not reclaim, replace, or spawn through them.
 * Discord generation 64 / Slack generation 67 contain synchronous provider-
 * subscription admission and ready-hook failures without revoking shared Router
 * attachment authority.
 * Discord generation 65 / Slack generation 68 fence the off-reconcile-tail
 * initial attachment replay introduced by #4542 so pre-upgrade daemon owners
 * cannot retain the earlier SessionRouter attachment contract.
 * The Discord 67 / Slack 70 fence covers the SessionRouter idle-poll/change-stamp
 * rollout (#4689). Both daemons construct a
 * SessionRouter whose idle tick no longer re-acquires the machine-global
 * session-index lock every 2s; staleness retirement moved to a 30s sweep and
 * lease heartbeats no longer force an authority reconcile. A pre-upgrade owner
 * would retain the old hot polling loop, so replacement is required.
 * Discord generation 72 / Slack generation 75 serialize same-generation
 * successor attachment admission behind predecessor provider retirement, so a
 * pre-upgrade owner cannot retain the queue race fixed by #5120.
 * Slack generation 80 persists and fences the inbound SDK dispatch boundary so
 * crashes, recovery, and attachment retirement cannot replay ambiguous work.
