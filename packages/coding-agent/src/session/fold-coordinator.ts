/**
 * Session-owned fold/wake coordinator.
 *
 * Folding a running foreground wait is a lifecycle handoff across three
 * independently scheduled domains — the tool observer, the job owner, and
 * agent-turn admission — so it needs ONE linearization point. That is this
 * coordinator: a synchronous prologue claims the fold and arms the steering
 * fence with no `await` in between, and only then does an async tail capture and
 * persist the receipt.
 *
 * Two invariants are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Identity is the `AsyncJob` instance, acquired once.** Job ids and
 *    generations are manager-local, so two managers can mint the same
 *    `bg_1`/`job:1` pair. Slots are therefore keyed by the object itself,
 *    obtained exactly once through the registration-bound
 *    {@link FoldAdapter.getJob} and retained for the rest of the transaction.
 *    Nothing in the fold path may consult an ambient, singleton, or
 *    endpoint-resolved manager.
 * 2. **A delivery callback can run more than once.** The async job manager
 *    re-pushes the SAME delivery object on retry, so the receipt is attached to
 *    a carrier keyed by that object BEFORE the slot is released. A retried
 *    delivery therefore still carries its receipt and can never silently
 *    degrade into an ordinary receipt-less completion.
