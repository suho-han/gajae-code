	 * host that has since finished coming up answer it, instead of ending the session on its
	 * first turn.
	 *
	 * A retry re-submits the prompt as a fresh, INDEPENDENT `turn.prompt` — `AcpSdkAdapter`
	 * assigns a new request id per call — so it must never re-run a turn that already did
	 * side-effecting work. If the failed turn executed a tool, re-submitting would run the

	 * started (agent_start / streamed text) but ran no tool produced no external effect, so
	 * recovering it is safe.
	 *
	 * Every gate is deliberately narrow so a genuine failure is still surfaced:
	 * - only the first logical prompt of the session (`!firstPromptDone`);
	 * - only the startup-readiness failure class the terminal itself classified

	 *   provider/transport classifier — never a client cancel, a `prompt_deadline_exceeded`,
	 *   a provider rejection, an agent runtime failure, a transport error, or a preflight
	 *   rejection, however little output they happened to produce;
	 * - only after the turn was observed starting (`promptObservedActivity`), the race's
	 *   fingerprint, which a turn rejected before it ever started never has;
	 * - but NEVER once the turn executed a tool (`promptObservedToolExecution`), so a
	 *   progressed, side-effecting turn is never re-run as a second turn;
	 * - but NEVER once the turn published assistant text/thought output
	 *   (`promptObservedAssistantOutput`), so a re-submit cannot expose duplicated output
	 *   from both attempts to the live ACP update stream — including a failed terminal's own
	 *   `finalText`, which is published on an async tail after this gate runs;
