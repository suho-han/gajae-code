/**
 * Explicit, audited cross-repository Ultragoal succession (#5353).
 *
 * An approved Ultragoal can be created in repository A while the implementation
 * belongs in repository B. The repository-binding guard (#2901) correctly refuses
 * to execute A's plan from B, and editing `repositoryBinding` or copying the
 * runtime directory would defeat that boundary and launder verification
 * provenance. This module adds the explicit alternative: a *successor* run in B
 * that adopts selected unfinished goals from A, with immutable provenance and
 * exactly one execution owner.
 *
 * Three durable records, all written through the sanctioned `state-writer`
 * primitives (gate G1):
 *
 * - **offer** (`succession/offer-<operationId>.json`, source side) — provenance
 *   plus the complete carryover: the source brief verbatim, each selected goal's
 *   objective verbatim, and its unresolved obligations.
 * - **outgoing fence** (`succession/outgoing-fence.json`, source side) — the
 *   durable ownership fence. Source admission (`startNextUltragoalGoal`,
 *   `checkpointUltragoalGoal`) refuses to schedule or checkpoint a fenced goal,
 *   so ownership leaves the source at the moment of the offer rather than when
 *   the target happens to adopt. Between the two, nobody owns the goal — which is
 *   the point: there is never an interval in which both runs may resume it.
 * - **adoption** (`succession/adoption.json`, target side) — the target claim and
 *   the recorded operation a retry must reconcile against.
 *
 * Invariants worth stating explicitly, because they are what make this auditable
 * rather than a rebind:
 *
 * - The source's `brief.md`, `goals.json` and `ledger.jsonl` are never written.
 *   Not rewritten, and not appended to either: the offer deliberately records no
 *   ledger event, because the recorded source digests must stay verifiable at
 *   adoption time. `succession` is therefore excluded from `RECONCILE_COMMANDS`,
 *   whose failure path appends a `reconcile_failed` row.
 * - Adoption performs **no** write to the source repository at all. This is
 *   structural, not a convention: `resolveGjcTarget` confines every sanctioned
 *   write to `<cwd>/.gjc/**`, and adoption runs with `cwd` at the target.
 * - Integrity digests are evidence, never authorization. A valid digest set with
 *   no fence, no bounded authorization, or a target the offer does not name is
 *   rejected.
 * - Nothing that carries authority is inherited: statuses, completion receipts,
 *   quality gates, validation batches, steering, reviews, approvals and the
 *   activated `gjcObjective` all stay behind as provenance. The successor plan is
 *   fresh, pending, and bound to the target repository's own identity.
 *
 * Scope limits, stated so a reviewer does not have to infer them: adoption needs
 * filesystem read access to the source worktree (no remote or offline adoption);
 * one outgoing fence exists per source session, so a session hands off once;
 * adoption is pinned to the exact target worktree the offer named, because linked
 * worktrees keep separate `.gjc` state; and there is deliberately no `revoke`
 * verb. Taking ownership back is the highest-risk operation in this design and
 * belongs in its own reviewed change: any read-then-delete of the fence races a
 * concurrent adoption and can revive the source while the target is starting, so
 * an unadopted offer keeps its goals fenced until such a verb exists.
