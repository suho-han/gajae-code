/**
 * Recovery guidance must only name commands a user can actually run, on every
 * surface that renders the message.
 *
 * The near-limit messages told users to run `gjc export <session-file>`. There is
 * no `export` subcommand (`cli-main.ts` registers none), so the shell started a
 * fresh interactive agent that read "export" as a prompt: the operator lost the
 * recovery they were told to perform and still held an unwritable session. The
 * root `--export` flag is unrelated — it renders HTML and exits, which never
 * produces a resumable session.
 *
 * It came back once already. `#5691` added a third near-limit error class with its
 * own hardcoded copy of the advice, and this matrix — which then enumerated only
 * the two append messages — could not see it. Cover the error FAMILY, not the
 * instances that happened to exist when the guard was written (#5732).
 *
 * Existence alone is not enough. `AgentSession` renders the near-limit guidance
 * to ACP/text consumers too, and `ACP_BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS` is filtered to
 * definitions carrying `handle`, so a `handleTui`-only command is unreachable
 * there — a different dead end, not a fix. Both registries are checked.
 *
 * These tests pin the properties that matter (every referenced command resolves,
 * on every surface) rather than one blessed sentence, so rewording stays free
 * while an unreachable command fails.
