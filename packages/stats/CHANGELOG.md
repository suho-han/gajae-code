# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.6] - 2026-09-24

## [0.17.5] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Add default/executor/planner/architect/critic usage totals to the stats summary and JSON output, attributing existing persisted subagent identities and leaving legacy sessions without identity metadata as `unknown`.

## [0.17.4] - 2026-09-23

## [0.17.3] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Preserve historical assistant session entries that omit `stopReason` when syncing `gjc stats`.

- Keep stats synchronization working when historical assistant entries contain partial cost data or malformed required metadata. Preserve finite recorded costs, estimate missing costs with existing catalog pricing, and skip malformed entries without changing source transcripts.
- Preserve recorded nonzero cost components with a zero total when reopening the stats database, and allow request-detail lookup past malformed JSONL entries.

## [0.11.8] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Restricted the local dashboard API to its exact loopback authority and same-origin browser requests, with POST-only bounded session sync.

## [0.11.7] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Compiled dashboard assets now remain in a validated in-memory archive map instead of being materialized in a predictable shared temporary cache.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-14

- Version aligned with the 0.5.1 monorepo release; no functional changes in this package.

- Version aligned with the 0.5.0 monorepo release; no functional changes in this package.

- Version aligned with the 0.4.4 monorepo release; no functional changes in this package.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- Refreshed stats package metadata for the GJC 0.4.0 release.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Refreshed stats package metadata for the GJC 0.2.2 release.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Refreshed stats package metadata for the GJC 0.2.1 release.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Refreshed stats package metadata for the GJC 0.2.0 release.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Released the current dev branch fixes with refreshed 0.1.3 package metadata.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Updated package metadata for the Gajae Code npm publication.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Bound the stats dashboard server explicitly to `127.0.0.1` so the local usage dashboard remains loopback-only by default.

## [15.1.6] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `gjc stats` crashing on first session sync in published `gjc-{linux,darwin,windows}-*` binaries with `BuildMessage: ModuleNotFound resolving "./packages/stats/src/sync-worker.ts"`; the release build script now lists the stats sync, browser tab, and JS eval workers as explicit `--compile` entrypoints so Bun emits them into bunfs, matching the dev build script and the AGENTS.md worker spawn contract. ([#1150](https://github.com/can1357/gajae-code/issues/1150))

## [15.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- Fixed incremental `parseSessionFile(path, fromOffset)` losing the active service tier when resuming past a `service_tier_change` entry, so priority OpenAI replies appended after the offset are now credited with `premiumRequests: 1` (regression introduced by 13f59162e which stopped folding priority-tier into per-message premium counts)

## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14
### Breaking Changes

- Raised the minimum required Bun version to >=1.3.14 in package metadata

### Changed

- Changed the "Premium Reqs" dashboard card to also include OpenAI priority service-tier requests (`serviceTier: "priority"`), counting each as 1 premium request alongside GitHub Copilot premium calls. Pre-existing sessions are backfilled on the next `gjc stats` run: a one-shot `premium_requests_priority_v1` sentinel wipes `file_offsets` so every session re-parses, and `insertMessageStats` now `UPSERT`s `premium_requests` (other columns untouched) using the `service_tier_change` entries already in the session log to retroactively credit priority traffic.

## [14.9.9] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added separate input-token and output-token totals to the overview dashboard cards.

### Fixed

- Fixed `gjc stats` in compiled binaries by using the serial sync path instead of spawning a raw file-asset worker that cannot import bundled parser code.
- Fixed behavior backfills after failed compiled-binary sync attempts by marking the backfill sentinel only after a successful full sync.

## [14.9.7] - 2026-05-12
### Breaking Changes

- Broke backward compatibility of behavior stats fields by replacing `yellingSentences`/`dramaRuns` with `yelling`/`anguish` and adding `negation`, `repetition`, `blame` in query result types and persisted `user_messages` schema

### Added

- Added `SyncOptions` to `syncAllSessions` with `onProgress` and `workers` to optionally show per-file sync progress and tune parser concurrency
- Added new frustration behavior metrics (`negation`, `repetition`, `blame`) plus a `frustration` aggregate in behavior charts, model tables, and summary cards

### Changed

- Changed sync ingestion to parse session files through a worker pool while applying parsed results and database writes on the main thread
- Changed behavior analysis to strip code blocks, XML/URLs, quoted lines, and placeholders before scoring and to suppress signals on long structured messages
- Changed dashboard metrics labels and totals to the new signal names, including replacing the old three-signal totals with `yelling`, `profanity`, `anguish`, and `frustration`
- Changed sync output to print a live terminal progress indicator while processing session files

### Fixed

- Fixed user-message attribution so assistant model/provider links are backfilled during incremental sync instead of being left unknown
- Fixed word-boundary regex handling in profanity detection so matching now works as intended in normal prose

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added time range selection options (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, All) to the dashboard header and bound them to reloading statistics for the selected window
- Added a **Behavior** dashboard page that tracks user yelling (CAPS), profanity, and dramatic punctuation (`!!!` / `???`) per day, with by-model comparisons mirroring the cost page
- Added a per-model behavior table to the **Behavior** page mirroring the Models table: sortable rows of CAPS / profanity / drama hits per model with sparkline trend and an expandable per-model breakdown chart
- Added optional `range` query parameter support on stats endpoints to retrieve metrics scoped to a requested time window

### Changed

- Changed the Costs dashboard summary to report totals, average per day, and top model for the selected time range instead of a fixed 30-day window and removed the previous-30-day trend comparison
- Changed behavior metrics ingestion to compute yelling from user message sentence-level uppercase ratios, filtering out short uppercase fragments so the behavior data is attributed to messages more accurately
- Removed per-chart 14/30/90 day pickers on Costs and Behavior pages so every page obeys the single time-range selector in the header
- Changed dashboard and stats queries to return data from the selected time window instead of always using all-time aggregates
- Changed the default displayed range in the UI/API to last 24h
- Added support for returning all data when `range=all` is requested

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of unknown `range` values by falling back to the last 24h instead of returning unscoped data
- Fixed `gjc stats` failing to build the client on globally-installed installs by promoting `tailwindcss` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` (the client build runs at runtime)

## [14.5.4] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- Fixed GPT cost reporting by deriving missing OpenAI code provider costs from the model catalog and backfilling existing zero-cost rows.

## [13.6.0] - 2026-03-03
### Fixed

- Include subtask session files in usage stats ([#250](https://github.com/can1357/gajae-code/issues/250))
