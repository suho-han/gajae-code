 * Whether a review's reported commit can be trusted as the head it actually reviewed.

 * branch almost every PR targets has no dismissal, and a rebase therefore turned every prior
 * approval into an apparent exact-head approval. Two live cases: an approval submitted
 * 4h24m before its attributed head existed, and another two days before (#5692).
 *
 * `headKnownAt` is the earliest time this head is PROVEN to have existed. A review submitted
 * before that cannot have reviewed it.
 *
 * It must come from a server-observed source. The head's committer date is NOT one: the
 * contributor sets it, so `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` backdating would make a stale approval look
 * fresh — a fail-open in the guard that exists to fail closed (#5692 review). The caller
 * therefore derives it from the PR timeline's force-push events, whose `created_at` GitHub
 * writes and the contributor cannot.
 *
 * Both timestamps must be readable and parseable; an unknown time is never treated as fresh.
 *
 * A TIE is refused, not admitted. GitHub serializes both values at second granularity, so a
 * review submitted at `12:00:00.9` and a force-push recorded at `12:00:00.1` are
 * indistinguishable — the review predates the head it claims and would still be accepted by
 * a strict `<`. No legitimate review is submitted in the same second as the force-push that
 * created the head it reviews, since the reviewer has to fetch and read it first, so
 * rejecting ties costs nothing real (#5692 review).

/**
 * When this head is proven to have existed, from server-observed evidence only.

 * Three outcomes, and conflating any two of them has produced a defect:
 * - `{ kind: "bound", at }` — a force-push is on record; that is when this head appeared.
 * - `{ kind: "unreadable" }` — a force-push is on record but its time cannot be read.
 *   Refuse: "cannot read the authority" is not "no authority exists".
 * - `{ kind: "unconstrained" }` — no force-push at all.
 *
 * `unconstrained` means "no additional constraint available", NOT "proven unconstrained".
 *
 * What is established: GitHub has empirically re-pointed APPROVED reviews onto a new tip
 * after a force-push (#5627 and #5622 both carry an approval whose `submitted_at` precedes
 * the committer date of the commit it names, which is impossible without re-pointing). The
 * exact conditions are undocumented — #5447 shows COMMENTED and CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews
 * staying on their original SHAs across four head changes including a force-push, so the
 * behaviour appears to be state-conditional rather than universal.
 *
 * What follows: an ordinary push leaves `commit_id` mismatched and fails naturally, a
 * recorded force-push gets a server-time constraint, and unreadable evidence refuses. When
 * no force-push is recorded we fall back to the plain exact-head binding, which is the
 * pre-#5692 behaviour — never weaker, and stronger wherever the event exists. Note that a
 * force-push is not always recorded as `head_ref_force_pushed`: one performed during this
 * work does not appear in #5447's timeline.
 *
 * The committer date is therefore not used as a floor at all. It is contributor-controlled
 * in both directions: backdating was the original hole, and forward-dating let an author
 * push the floor past every legitimate approval and block their own PR (#5692 review).
