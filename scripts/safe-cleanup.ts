/**
 * Fail-closed recursive-deletion boundary for test processes (issue #4794).
 *
 * An operator's real `$HOME` was destroyed by test cleanup activity. The
 * structural fix is a single verdict function every deletion path consults:
 * a recursive removal is permitted ONLY when the target is a strictly-nested,
 * process-owned path inside an explicitly allowed root (a supported OS temp
 * root or this repository worktree), and is NEVER the real home, an ancestor
 * of it, the filesystem root, a shallow path, or a symlink-resolved escape.
 *
 * Enforcement layers (they complement each other; none is sufficient alone):
 *
 * 1. `safeRm`/`safeRmSync` — the explicit contract. Migrated cleanup code
 *    calls these; a refusal throws `SafeCleanupRefusalError` so the failure is
 *    a normal, attributable test error.
 * 2. `installRuntimeDeletionGuard()` — a last-resort runtime backstop for the
 *    surfaces Bun 1.4.0 actually allows intercepting: the shared `fs.promises`
 *    object (`fs.promises.rm`/`rmdir` and `import { promises }`) and the CJS
 *    `require("node:fs")`/`require("node:fs/promises")` exports objects.
 *    ESM namespace bindings (`import * as fs` top-level `rmSync`/`rm`) are
 *    immutable snapshots in Bun and CANNOT be intercepted at runtime — that
 *    gap is closed by layer 3, and the interception matrix is pinned by
 *    `safe-cleanup-guard.test.ts` so a future runtime change is detected.
 * 3. `scripts/check-unsafe-rmrf.ts` — the static guard that bans raw
 *    recursive `fs.rm*`/`fs.rmdir*` calls in HOME-seam test files, making the
 *    un-interceptable sync surface deterministic at check time.
 *
 * The guard is test-process-scoped on purpose: it is installed only from
 * `scripts/test-preload.ts` (bunfig `[test] preload`). Product runtime and
 * non-test tooling never load it, so third-party and production behavior is
 * untouched. Within a test process, a third-party dependency that recursively
 * deletes inside the allowed roots keeps working; anything else aborts the
 * process — that is the intended fail-closed behavior.
