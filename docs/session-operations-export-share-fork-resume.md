Stars are per-transcript discovery metadata and require a persistent session; `/star` and `/unstar` reject `--no-session` runtimes. New sessions and forks start unstarred even when their parent is starred. Stars affect resume-picker and read-only dashboard ordering only; `--continue`, retention pruning, and explicit deletion keep their existing behavior.

## Import external sessions

`/import-session <transcript-file> [--provider codex|claude]` imports one explicit Codex CLI rollout transcript, Claude Code transcript, or claude.ai conversation export. Format detection is content-based; `--provider` narrows detection and fails closed on a mismatch. The command never scans private live process state or provider history directories.

The importer reconstructs user/assistant context and bounded tool evidence in a fresh native session. Unsupported or malformed records are never silently dropped: aggregate counts and at most 512 full-record SHA-256 quarantine proofs are retained in provenance. The source basename, provider/format, source/session identifier when available, exact source digest and byte count, converter/sanitizer versions, mapping/redaction counts, and bounded-context state are persisted. Raw provider archives are never copied into the session store.

The source is opened once with no-follow semantics and read through that retained descriptor; device, inode, link count, size, mtime, and ctime must remain exact through the complete read. Regular hard-linked exports are accepted without weakening managed-session storage, whose files remain single-linked. Secret-bearing values, Authorization/Cookie headers, terminal escapes, C0/C1 controls, bidi/zero-width controls, tool labels, IDs, titles, cwd metadata, and source diagnostics are sanitized before display or persistence.

Each invocation creates one new session, verifies that it reopens with the same captured destination authority and reconstructs continuable history, then releases that authority. Imports are refused while the current session is streaming. Imported sessions do not replace the active session automatically; select the new session with `/resume`.

The command is available only on Linux in the interactive TUI and trusted local startup command path. It is neither advertised nor dispatched over ACP or remote-control transports.
## Export and dump

### `/export [outputPath]` (interactive)

Flow:

1. `InputController` routes `/export...` to `CommandController.handleExportCommand`.
2. The command splits on whitespace and uses only the first argument after `/export` as `outputPath`.
3. `AgentSession.exportToHtml()` calls `exportSessionToHtml(sessionManager, state, { outputPath, themeName })`.
4. On success, UI shows path and opens the file in browser.

Behavior details:

- `--copy`, `clipboard`, and `copy` arguments are explicitly rejected with a warning to use `/dump`.
- Export embeds session header/entries/leaf plus current `systemPrompt` and tool descriptions from agent state.
- No session entries are appended during export.

Caveat:

- Argument parsing is whitespace-based (`text.split(/\s+/)`), so quoted paths with spaces are not preserved as a single path by this command path.

### `--export <inputSessionFile> [outputPath]` (CLI)

Flow in `main.ts`:

1. Handled early (before interactive/session startup).
2. Calls `exportFromFile(inputPath, outputPath?)`.
3. `SessionManager.open(inputPath)` loads entries, then HTML is generated and written.
4. Process prints `Exported to: ...` and exits.

Behavior details:

- Missing input file surfaces as `File not found: <path>`.
- This path does not create an `AgentSession` and does not mutate any running session.

### `/dump` (interactive clipboard export)

Flow:

1. `CommandController.handleDumpCommand()` calls `session.formatSessionAsText()`.
2. If empty string, reports `No messages to dump yet.`
3. Otherwise copies to clipboard via native `copyToClipboard`.

Dump content includes:

- System prompt
- Active model/thinking level
- Tool definitions + parameters
- User/assistant messages
- Thinking blocks and tool calls
- Tool results and execution blocks (except `excludeFromContext` bash/python entries)
- Custom/hook/file mention/branch summary/compaction summary entries

No session persistence changes are made by dumping.

## Share

`/share` is interactive-only and always starts by exporting current session to a temp HTML file.

### Phase 1: temp export

- Temp file path: `${os.tmpdir()}/${Snowflake.next()}.html`
- Uses `session.exportToHtml(tmpFile)`
- If export fails (notably in-memory sessions), share ends with error.

### Phase 2: custom share handler (if present)

`loadCustomShare()` checks `~/.gjc/agent` for first existing candidate:

- `share.ts`
- `share.js`
- `share.mjs`

Requirements:

- Module must default-export a function `(htmlPath) => Promise<CustomShareResult | string | undefined>`.

If present and valid:

- UI enters `Sharing...` loader state.
- Handler result interpretation:
  - string => treated as URL, shown and opened
  - object => `url` and/or `message` shown; `url` opened
  - `undefined`/falsy => generic `Session shared`
- Temp file is removed after completion.

Critical fallback behavior:

- If custom handler exists but loading fails, command errors and returns.
- If custom handler executes and throws, command errors and returns.
- In both failure cases, it **does not** fall back to GitHub gist.
- Gist fallback happens only when no custom share script exists.

### Phase 3: default gist fallback

Only when no custom share handler is found:

1. Validates `gh auth status`.
2. Shows `Creating gist...` loader.
3. Runs `gh gist create --public=false <tmpFile>`.
4. Parses gist URL, derives gist id, builds preview URL `https://gistpreview.github.io/?<id>`.
5. Shows both preview and gist URLs; opens preview.

Cancellation/abort semantics in share:

- Loader has `onAbort` hook that restores editor UI and reports `Share cancelled`.
- The underlying `gh gist create` command is not passed an abort signal in this code path; cancellation is UI-level and checked after command returns.

## Fork

Interactive `/fork` starts an independent continuation from a selected user prompt. It reuses the existing user-message selector and session-branch lifecycle rather than duplicating the whole active transcript.

### Preconditions and immediate guards

- All prompt-fork entry points (`/fork`, `app.session.fork`, and branch-configured double Escape) refuse active responses, compaction, foreground Bash/Python execution, or pending prompt submission.
- They require a persistent active session. A `--no-session` runtime is refused because the result must be independently resumable.

### Interactive flow

1. `/fork` opens the same user-prompt selector used by the ordinary user-message branch flow. Once admitted, opening the picker closes any active `/btw` side chat.
2. Cancelling the selector leaves the active session and transcript unchanged; the closed side chat is not reopened.
3. Selecting a user prompt runs `AgentSession.branch()` at that prompt boundary. Its `session_before_branch` hook may cancel the operation; a successful switch emits `session_branch`.
4. A new persistent session is created with the history before the selected prompt, and the TUI switches to it.
5. The selected prompt text is restored to the editor for editing. It is not submitted automatically. Session-specific TODOs, title/status, and other identity-bound UI state are synchronized to the child.

If branching fails before the successor is committed, the original session remains active. If a later restoration step fails after commit, the UI is reconciled to the already-active child and reports that the fork was created but restoration failed; it does not pretend the original session is still active.

The original session file and transcript remain unchanged. The new session keeps the same cwd and works against the same files, and the command itself does not modify those files; `/fork` does not create or switch a Git branch or worktree. `/tree` remains same-session navigation.

### Low-level full-session `AgentSession.fork()`

The low-level `AgentSession.fork()` API remains a whole-session duplicate operation and is not the interactive `/fork` prompt-selection flow:

1. Emits `session_before_switch` with `reason: "fork"` (cancellable).
2. Flushes pending writes.
3. Calls `SessionManager.fork()`.
4. Copies the artifacts directory from the old session namespace to the new namespace (best-effort; non-ENOENT copy failures are logged, not fatal).
5. Updates `agent.sessionId`.
6. Emits `session_switch` with `reason: "fork"`.

`SessionManager.fork()` requires persistent mode and an existing session file. It creates a new session id and JSONL path, rewrites the header with a new id and timestamp plus the unchanged cwd and previous session id as `parentSession`, and retains all non-header entries.

In-memory `SessionManager.fork()` returns `undefined`, so low-level `AgentSession.fork()` returns `false`.

### CLI `--fork <id|path>`

Startup `--fork` is resolved before normal session creation:

1. `--fork` is rejected with `--no-session`.
2. Path-like values (`/`, `\`, or `.jsonl`) call `SessionManager.forkFrom(path, cwd, sessionDir)`.
3. Other values resolve like resumable session ids via current scope and then global search when allowed.
4. The forked file is created in the current cwd/session-dir scope and becomes the active session manager for startup.

### Managed directory migration during session operations

Default persistent creates and forks write only to the managed v2 workspace scope. A resume/list operation may surface a validated legacy candidate for the same canonical workspace identity; with `session.directoryMigration: "copy-retain"`, the migration path copies it into v2 and retains the source. It never replaces an existing destination, and a migration tombstone prevents completed/retired legacy work from being retried as fresh work. `disabled` leaves legacy data in place.

The migration path does not delete legacy sessions or artifacts automatically. It fails closed on conflicting bindings, changed source identity, unsafe artifact trees, or unavailable owner-only path security; it does not claim authentication or protection against hostile concurrent filesystem races. Explicit `--session-dir` remains an operator-selected override.

## Resume and continue

## Interactive `/resume`

Flow:

1. Opens session selector populated via `SessionManager.list(currentCwd, currentSessionDir)`.
2. On selection, `SelectorController.handleResumeSession(sessionPath)` calls `session.switchSession(sessionPath)`.
3. UI clears/rebuilds chat and todos, then reports `Resumed session`.

Notes:

- This picker only lists sessions in the current session directory scope.
- It does not use global cross-project search.

## CLI `--resume`

### `--resume` (no value)

- `main.ts` lists sessions for current cwd/sessionDir and opens picker.
- Selected path is opened with `SessionManager.open(selectedPath)` before session creation.

### `--resume <value>`

`createSessionManager()` resolution order:

1. If value looks like path (`/`, `\`, or `.jsonl`), open directly.
2. Else treat as id prefix:
   - search current scope (`SessionManager.list(cwd, sessionDir)`)
   - if not found and no explicit `sessionDir`, search global (`SessionManager.listAll()`)

Cross-project id match behavior:

- If matched session cwd differs from current cwd, CLI asks:
  - `Session found in different project ... Fork into current directory? [y/N]`
- On yes: `SessionManager.forkFrom(match.path, cwd, sessionDir)` creates a new local forked file.
- On no/non-TTY default: command errors.

## CLI `--continue`

`SessionManager.continueRecent(cwd, sessionDir)`:

1. Resolves session dir for current cwd.
2. Reads terminal-scoped breadcrumb first.
3. Falls back to most recently modified session file.
4. Opens found session; if none exists, creates new session.

This is startup-only behavior; there is no interactive `/continue` slash command.

## How session switching actually mutates runtime state

`AgentSession.switchSession(sessionPath)` does the runtime transition used by resume-like operations:

1. Emit `session_before_switch` with `reason: "resume"` and `targetSessionFile` (cancellable).
2. Disconnect agent event subscription and abort in-flight work.
3. Clear queued steering/follow-up/next-turn messages.
4. Flush current session manager writes.
5. `sessionManager.setSessionFile(sessionPath)` and update `agent.sessionId`.
6. Build session context from loaded entries.
7. Emit `session_switch` with `reason: "resume"`.
8. Replace agent messages from context.
9. Restore model (if available in current registry).
10. Restore or initialize thinking level.
11. Reconnect agent event subscription.

No new session file is created by `switchSession()` itself.

## Event emissions and cancellation points

### Switch/fork lifecycle hooks

For `newSession`, `fork`, and `switchSession`:

- Before event: `session_before_switch`
  - reasons: `new`, `fork`, `resume`
  - cancellable by returning `{ cancel: true }`
- After event: `session_switch`
  - same reason set
  - includes `previousSessionFile`

`ExtensionRunner.emit()` returns early on the first cancelling before-event result.

### Custom tool `onSession` behavior

SDK bridges extension session events to custom tool `onSession` callbacks:

- `session_switch` -> `onSession({ reason: "switch", previousSessionFile })`
- `session_branch` -> `reason: "branch"`
- `session_start` -> `reason: "start"`
- `session_tree` -> `reason: "tree"`
- `session_shutdown` -> `reason: "shutdown"`

These callbacks are observational; they do not cancel switch/fork.

### Other cancellation surfaces relevant to this doc

- `/fork` is blocked while a response, compaction, foreground Bash/Python execution, or prompt submission is active.
- `/resume` selector can be cancelled by user closing selector.
- Cross-project `--resume <id>` can be cancelled by declining fork prompt.
- `/share` has UI abort path (`Share cancelled`) for gist flow; it does not wire process-kill semantics for `gh gist create` in this code path.

## Non-persistent (in-memory) session behavior

When session manager is created with `SessionManager.inMemory()` (`--no-session`):

- Session file path is absent.
- `/export` and `/share` fail with `Cannot export in-memory session to HTML` (propagated to command error UI).
- `/fork` fails because `SessionManager.fork()` requires persistence.
- `/dump` still works because it serializes in-memory agent state.
- CLI resume/continue semantics are bypassed if `--no-session` is set, because manager creation returns in-memory immediately.

## Known implementation caveats (as of current code)

- `SelectorController.handleResumeSession()` does not check the boolean result from `session.switchSession(...)`; a hook-cancelled switch can still proceed through UI "Resumed session" repaint/status path.
- `/share` custom-share failures do not degrade to default gist fallback; they terminate the command with error.
- `/export` argument tokenization is simplistic and does not preserve quoted paths with spaces.
