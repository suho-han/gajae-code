# Crash fingerprinting and `gjc crash report`

GJC writes a durable, rotation-immune crash log (`~/.gjc/agent/gjc-crash.log`) for every
fatal exception. This page documents how those records get a stable identity, how the
counts are aggregated, and the privacy contract of the assisted reporting flow.

**The `gjc crash report` GitHub issue flow never transmits anything without an explicit,
per-invocation, digest-confirmed confirmation. Fully automatic issue creation is an
explicit non-goal. The separate Sentry upstream is default-off and config-gated; it
transmits only fields approved by `sanitizeExternalCrashV1`.**

## 1. Fingerprinting (algorithm v1)

Every new fatal record gains one machine-readable identity line:

```
gjc-crash-record.v1 fp:<32 hex> fpv:1 id:<random>
```

The fingerprint is computed at `recordFatalCrash` time from the already-captured
diagnostic text (error name, message, stack) — the throwable is never read again.

- **Canonical serialization** is length-prefixed UTF-8 (`<byteLength>:<bytes>`) over
  `"gjc-crash-fp.v1"`, `errorName`, `normalizedMessageClass`, and up to three normalized
  in-app frames. The digest is sha256 truncated to 128 bits, published as 32 lowercase
  hex characters. The algorithm version is recorded as `fpv` beside every value.
- **Message normalization is typed, not "strip all digits".** Absolute POSIX/Windows/UNC
  /BunFS paths become `<path>`, home-rooted paths become `<home>`, UUIDs become `<uuid>`,
  hex runs become `<hex>`, digit runs of four or more become `<num>`, and everything
  `redactCrashSecrets` rewrites keeps its marker. Runs of three or fewer digits and errno
  names survive verbatim, so `404` and `500` stay distinct crash classes.
- **Frame normalization** keeps the install-root-relative file path and the function name
  and drops line/column numbers, which churn on every release. Source-tree, compiled
  BunFS (`/$bunfs/root/…`, `B:\~BUN\root\…`) and Windows stacks normalize identically.
  Dependency and `node:`/`bun:` frames are skipped. A stack with no in-app frame yields
  the literal `<no-app-frame>`; distinct roots can merge there, which is an accepted and
  documented v1 property.

### The fingerprint is a public, pseudonymous correlation token

It is deterministic over low-entropy inputs, therefore dictionary-testable, and it links
the same crash class across installs and accounts. It is **not** a confidentiality
control. It never hashes secret or path-bearing raw text — only the normalized form —
and the consent preview says so before anything is sent.

### Legacy records are `unmatchable`

Records written before this feature carry no identity line. The crash log cannot be
trusted as a parseable database (the field corpus contains an interleaved record where
two headers merged onto one line under concurrent writers), so no retroactive matching is
attempted and pre-feature records are not reportable through this flow.

## 2. Event journal and compacted index

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.gjc/agent/gjc-crash-events.jsonl` | Append-only journal. **Source of increments.** |
| `~/.gjc/agent/gjc-crash-index.json` | Compacted, advisory signature index. |

- The **fatal path** writes exactly one bounded line (≤ 512 B) with `O_APPEND` and nothing
  else: no parse, no lock, no rename, no read. A failure is swallowed, and a latch makes a
  crash-during-crash skip journal work entirely.
- **Compaction** happens at the next startup under the cross-process file lock. The
  journal is rotated aside before it is read, occurrence ids are deduped, and a leftover
  file from a crashed compaction is picked up by the next run, so the merge is idempotent
  and concurrent compactors cannot drop counts.
- **Strict schema on read:** exact fingerprint alphabet and length, safe-integer bounds,
  timestamp bounds, unknown-key and control-character rejection, null-prototype parsing,
  no-follow opens. A malformed or hostile-valued index is quarantined to a capped number
  of `.corrupt-*` siblings and rebuilt from the journal.
- **The index is advisory.** It can never authorize, suppress or auto-target anything; a
  `reportedAt` stamp changes default highlighting, not permission.
- **Bounds:** message preview ≤ 512 B per entry, entry ≤ 1 KiB, index ≤ 256 KiB, 128
  signatures. **Unreported signatures are never evicted.** Overflow evicts only reported
  or dismissed entries; when nothing is evictable the compactor stops adding new entries
  and records an overflow marker that `gjc crash report` surfaces.
- `lifetimeCount` (from the journal, monotonic) and `retainedCount` (recomputed from the
  identity markers still present in the capped crash log) are tracked separately, so the
  512 KiB crash-log cap reset cannot silently deflate a signature's history.
- Multi-account installs that symlink one agent dir **share this state deliberately**:
  the scope is the agent dir, exactly like the crash log itself.

## 3. `gjc crash report`

```sh
gjc crash list            # local signatures, no network, no gh
gjc crash list --json
gjc crash report          # interactive review-and-submit flow
```

The ordering **is** the consent boundary — no network, auth, repo or `gh` probe happens
before step 5:

1. List signatures (count, first/last seen, algorithm version, reported state). A
   non-interactive invocation prints a report file path and refuses to submit.
2. Select a signature; the newest post-feature record with that fingerprint is loaded.
3. The body is built by `sanitizeExternalCrashV1` — a separate, stricter contract than
   the persistence-time `redactCrashSecrets` scrub (which is best-effort credential
   hygiene and is not a privacy guarantee). Field allowlist; paths → placeholders; URLs
   parsed and stripped of userinfo/query/fragment (unparseable ones dropped);
   C0/C1/ANSI/OSC/bidi/zero-width controls removed; CRLF normalized; pid and exact
   timestamps omitted (coarse first/last-seen dates retained); labels sanitized like
   values; per-field and whole-body byte caps (body ≤ 48 KiB). **Scanner uncertainty
   refuses the submission** rather than warning and continuing.
4. Crash-derived text lives only inside fenced blocks with backticks neutralized and `@`
   de-fanged. The title is generic (`crash: <errorName> in <top-frame-path>`, from
   normalized inputs only) and the marker `gjc-crash-fp.v1:<32hex>` is emitted outside
   crash-derived blocks so a forged in-text marker cannot impersonate one.
5. **Immutable snapshot + consent.** The exact final bytes are written to a securely
   created 0600 file (exclusive create, no symlink follow), shown verbatim with their
   sha256 digest and byte length, and confirmed. What is sent is exactly that snapshot.
   The preview names the fixed target repository and, after consent, the active `gh`
   identity.
6. **Duplicate check (after consent, read-only).** The repository is searched for the
   exact versioned marker with `--repo` pinned, and the result URL is validated against
   the canonical repository. A hit is a **candidate only**: the default action prints the
   existing issue URL and stops. An optional "+1" comment needs its own separately-worded
   confirmation and records a per-issue idempotency stamp, so re-invocations and sibling
   accounts on a shared agent dir cannot repeat it. Timeout, auth failure or ambiguity
   **refuses to create** unless the user explicitly overrides the duplicate check.
7. **Submission.** `gh issue create --repo <canonical>` with a body carrying every
   `bug_report.yml` required field: crash-derived fields prefilled, non-derivable fields
   (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, provider, area) filled in interactively before
   the snapshot is frozen, or rendered as an explicit "not captured — please fill in"
   prompt. No token is ever read, stored or embedded. Without `gh`, the flow prints the
   snapshot path plus a prefilled URL built with `URL`/`URLSearchParams` against a fixed
   allowlisted origin carrying only bounded-grammar fields (generic title, fingerprint,
   semver) — never message or stack content, and never auto-opened.
8. On success, `reportedAt` is stamped through the journal so concurrent writers cannot
   lose it.

## 4. Startup nudge

One bounded status line at interactive startup when an unreported, undismissed signature
gained records since the last nudge, at most once per 24 h per agent dir. It reads local
state only — **this piece never transmits anything**.

- Suppressed for print mode, SDK/ACP hosts, workers, daemons, `--version`/`--help` and
  `startup.quiet`; it is routed through the centralized status surface, never `console.*`.
- Dismissal is explicit (the dismiss action in `gjc crash report`), never inferred from an
  ignored line.
- `crashReport.nudge: false` disables it. Honest default statement: the default-on nudge
  **does** change startup output by design (one line, bounded, rate-limited); transmission
  remains impossible without the full consent flow.

## 5. Upstream relay (opt-in)

This is a separate channel from `gjc crash report`, with separate rules. It is disabled by
default: `crashReport.upstream` defaults to `off`, and `crashReport.upstreamDsn` supplies
the Sentry DSN only when the upstream is enabled. With no DSN, network behavior does not
change. No DSN is compiled into the binary, so there is no default destination.

Both keys are read from the **user/global settings layer only**, never the merged view.
Project `.gjc` configuration cannot enable the relay and cannot choose its destination, so
opening an untrusted repository cannot turn on transmission or redirect crash signatures
that were recorded before that repository existed on the machine. Values are re-validated
on read: anything other than the literal `sentry` is treated as `off`, and a non-string DSN
is treated as absent, so a hand-edited global config fails closed. The
`GJC_CRASH_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is only consulted once that trusted global
opt-in is already on; it cannot enable the relay by itself.

The automatic relay always reads fatal and handled stores from the trusted agent
directory (`getTrustedAgentFile`); it never uses XDG-selected paths as automatic-egress
input. Ordinary crash state operations may still use trusted inherited XDG state, but
checkout-controlled XDG paths are never uploaded.

The relay never runs on the fatal path. It runs at the next **interactive** startup during index
compaction; other modes can explicitly invoke `gjc crash relay`, preserving the crashing
process's exactly-one-`O_APPEND` write. It is bounded
to 8 signatures per run across both fatal and handled stores, with fatal first, and a 10s per-request timeout. The exact
payload keys that leave the machine are `event_id`, `timestamp`, `platform`, `level`,
`logger`, `release`, `environment`, `fingerprint`, `exception.values[].type`,
`.value`, `.stacktrace.frames[].filename`, `.function`, `.in_app`, `tags`, `extra`, and
`sdk`. The payload excludes `user`, `server_name`, `contexts`, `breadcrumbs`, `request`,
`modules`, environment variables, argv, and hostname.

`sanitizeExternalCrashV1` is the egress contract. Any refusal drops that signature's
send; the relay never falls back to a less-sanitized payload. Consequently no prompt
text, source code, file contents, or credentials are included. The gjc fingerprint is
sent as Sentry's `fingerprint` array, making grouping ours rather than Sentry's heuristics:
one upstream issue per gjc signature.

Timestamps follow the same coarsening rule as the issue flow: the event `timestamp` is
truncated to UTC midnight of the crash date, so an exact crash time -- which is a
behavioural record of when a specific person was working -- never leaves the machine. The
envelope omits `sent_at`; the receiver observes the true arrival time from the request.

The relay sends once per occurrence batch. A `relayed` journal event stores the
journal-append-order record id represented by the accepted envelope, independently of
the display-time `lastSeen` maximum. An occurrence appended between the snapshot and
the durable stamp therefore leaves the signature due again even when its timestamp is
equal or backdated. Existing indexes that only have `relayedAt` stay covered when that
stamp still covers `lastSeen`; a downgrade that advanced `relayedAt` without rewriting
`relayedRecordId` is treated the same when the latest append is also the lastSeen
record. The event id is derived from that fingerprint and append-order record id, so a
retry after upstream acceptance but before local durability uses the same upstream
identity. A failed journal append after a 2xx POST is a failed send: no durable
watermark is written.

`gjc crash relay` exits non-zero when any signature was refused by the sanitizer or failed
in transport, so a partially delivered batch is never reported to automation as a success.

### State provenance and legacy stores

User-level state is anchored to the provenance-checked home selected by the shared directory
resolver, not to raw `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` values supplied by a checkout. External XDG directories
(`XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, and `XDG_CACHE_HOME`) are accepted only from trusted process
configuration; values declared by the current checkout's `.env` cannot redirect trusted agent files
or the relay's input stores. A checkout may still declare an XDG variable for ordinary project-facing
caches, so those paths can move, but they are never trusted crash-report input.
If a checkout declares `HOME` in its `.env`, the resolver uses an account home that is
independent evidence — one that does not merely echo the runtime home (the Linux
`/etc/passwd` lookup qualifies; a runtime `userInfo().homedir` that only mirrors the
environment variable does not, which is the failure #4773 reported on identities
without a local passwd entry). When no such home exists, the trusted home resolves to
the filesystem-root sentinel, user state is marked unavailable, and every user-scope
accessor refuses — credential resolution stays fail-closed and never reads a
checkout-controlled home.

Project discovery uses the nearest existing `.gjc` directory, then the checkout's `.git` root as a
fallback anchor. With an explicit project scope and neither anchor, the resolver uses `<cwd>/.gjc`
instead of falling back to the user's home. The historical `~/.gemini` store remains a read-only
compatibility source after trusted `.gjc/agent`; it is not a crash relay store and cannot override
trusted state.

The fingerprint remains a public, pseudonymous correlation token, not a confidentiality
control. In addition to its local correlation role, it links the same crash class across
installs inside the upstream project.

## 6. Handled tool errors

Sections 1-5 describe *fatal* crashes: `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection`. A tool
that throws and is caught never reaches that path, so those failures were previously
invisible to both `gjc crash list` and the relay.

Handled tool errors are captured at `finishExecuteToolSpan`, which already holds the live
`Error` with an intact stack. Capture is deliberately narrow: only `status === "error"`
with an unexpected `Error` carrying a non-empty stack is recorded. Designed tool outcomes
(`ToolError`/`ToolAbortError`, including permission refusals, policy denials, command
failures, and rejected edit anchors) are marked before they cross into the generic agent
runtime and never enter the crash recorder. Aborted calls, blocked calls, and non-`Error`
throws are also not recorded.

The same reasoning rules out hooking `logger.error`: of its call sites, nearly all pass
`String(error)` or `error.message`, so the stack is already gone by the time the logger
sees it.

Handled errors get their own files -- `gjc-error.log`, `gjc-error-events.jsonl`,
`gjc-error-index.json` -- rather than sharing the fatal store. They are high-volume and
fatal crashes are rare and precious; under a shared cap the noisy class would evict the
signal and break `gjc crash report`. Their fingerprint uses the error class and first
normalized in-app frame, not the full wrapper stack, so recurring failures group together
even when call-site frames or command output change. Everything else is reused verbatim:
the same record format, the same `redactCrashSecrets` scrubbing, the same v1 fingerprint,
the same `sanitizeExternalCrashV1` egress contract.

Two bounds keep the capture path cheap enough to run inside a live turn. A fingerprint is
recorded at most once while it stays hot, so a tool failing in a loop writes one record rather
than thousands. The dedupe set itself is bounded at 256 entries with LRU eviction: at
saturation the coldest fingerprint is evicted so a long-lived process keeps recording newly
seen failure classes instead of going permanently blind past the cap. Capture never throws: a
handled tool error must not become an unhandled one.

Upstream, handled errors are relayed by the same code as fatal crashes and differ only by
`level` (`error` rather than `fatal`). Fatal signatures are relayed first, so a noisy
handled class cannot starve them when the per-run cap binds.
