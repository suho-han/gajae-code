# External controller integration guide

This guide is for authors of bots and orchestrators that want to drive Gajae-Code (`gjc`) without scraping terminal scrollback. Hermes, OpenClaw, GitHub bots, chatops bots, and custom schedulers are examples of external controllers; none of them need bespoke GJC behavior if they use Coordinator MCP, the broker-bound SDK session CLI, or a managed SDK-core adapter.

GJC is an external runner. Your controller owns queueing, identity, policy, and credentials; GJC owns the coding-agent session, workflows, tools, artifacts, and evidence inside the selected repository or worktree.

## Integration surfaces

Use the smallest surface that fits your bot:

| Surface | Best for | Command | Stability notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coordinator MCP | Any external controller that can discover SDK-backed sessions, send turns, answer questions, and read artifacts. | `gjc mcp-serve coordinator` | Preferred orchestration surface. `gjc mcp-serve hermes` is a compatibility alias, not a separate contract. |
| Setup adapter | Rendering a portable MCP config and operator instructions for a controller profile. | `gjc setup hermes --root /path/to/repo` | Compatibility-oriented config renderer; does not call an LLM or validate provider credentials. |
| SDK session CLI | Broker-bound semantic session operations and explicit raw SDK dispatch with JSON output. | `gjc sdk session list|inspect|send|status|tail|close|retire` or `gjc sdk session raw control|query|global` | Resolves authority through the broker and never exposes endpoint credentials. |

## Recommended architecture

```text
external controller / bot
  ├─ chooses repo/worktree and task policy
  ├─ starts MCP server: gjc mcp-serve coordinator
  ├─ discovers or starts one SDK-backed GJC session
  ├─ sends one bounded turn at a time
  ├─ answers structured questions explicitly
  ├─ watches the durable lifecycle event cursor first
  └─ reads artifacts/reports from allowlisted roots
```

Do not infer completion from terminal output. Treat SDK-backed durable turn state as authoritative. Tmux identifiers, when present, are advisory process metadata only.

## Coordinator MCP setup

Render a non-mutating config preview:

```sh
gjc setup hermes --root /path/to/repo --profile my-bot --repo my-repo
```

Install into a Hermes-compatible profile only when the target path is intentional:

```sh
gjc setup hermes \
  --root /path/to/repo \
  --profile my-bot \
  --repo my-repo \
  --mutation sessions,questions,reports \
  --profile-dir /path/to/hermes/profile \
  --install
```

The generated `mcp_servers` block carries `timeout` / `connect_timeout` (default 180/60 whole seconds), the host MCP client's per-call budgets — not a GJC turn deadline, and not the coordinator per-call caps (`watch_events` `timeout_ms` up to 30000 ms; `await_turn` bounded at 30 minutes). Tune them with `gjc setup hermes --timeout <seconds>` / `--connect-timeout <seconds>` (1–3600); `--install` preserves installed numeric values when a flag is omitted, and an explicit flag overrides them.

Run provider-independent contract smokes before trying a live model:

```sh
gjc setup hermes --root /path/to/repo --smoke --json
gjc mcp-serve coordinator --check --json
```

`gjc mcp-serve coordinator --check --json` (and the `hermes` compatibility alias) is a discovery-only, non-mutating catalog check. Its successful JSON payload retains `ok`, `server`, `readOnly`, and `tools`, and adds `catalog: { "ready": true, "reason": null }` plus `broker`. `broker.discovery_status` is `ready`, `unavailable`, or `error`; its reason is one of `absent_or_invalid`, `unsupported_state_version`, `discovery_access_denied`, or `discovery_read_failed` (or `null` when ready). `broker.operational_ready` is always `null`: this check observes canonical broker discovery but does not connect, ensure/bootstrap, write, repair, or delete. It reports `bootstrap_supported: true` and `bootstrap_attempted: false`, and never exposes broker paths, authority, endpoint, process, token, or raw error details. The human output remains the server/tools summary. SDK check behavior is separate and unchanged.

The generated config uses these environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_WORKDIR_ROOTS` | Required allowlist for workdirs and artifact paths. |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_MUTATIONS` | Startup opt-in for mutation classes: `sessions`, `questions`, `reports`, or `all`. |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_SESSION_COMMAND` | Command used to start real GJC sessions, defaulting to `gjc --worktree` in generated setup. |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_PROFILE` | Optional profile namespace so one bot cannot enumerate another profile's state. |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_REPO` | Optional repo namespace so one repo cannot enumerate another repo's state. |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_STATE_ROOT` | Optional coordination state root; defaults under `.gjc/state/coordinator-mcp`. |
| `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_ARTIFACT_BYTE_CAP` | Maximum bytes returned by artifact reads. |

Mutating calls require both startup opt-in, per-call `allow_mutation: true`, and the required caller-provided `idempotency_key`. Missing any one fails closed.

## Generic smoke strategy

Use three different smoke levels so CI does not depend on one operator's model, API key, or desktop:

| Smoke | Required for CI | What it proves | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contract smoke | Yes | MCP server metadata, tool discovery, exported tool names, input schemas, read-only default, and mutation-gate failures. No provider credentials required. | `gjc mcp-serve coordinator --check --json` and focused tests around `tools/list` plus mutation denial. |
| Dry-run lifecycle smoke | Yes when changed behavior affects lifecycle state | A generic controller can discover a mocked SDK session, send a turn, observe active-turn protection, report terminal status, and read the completed turn without a real LLM. | `bun test packages/coding-agent/test/coordinator-mcp-server.test.ts` uses mocked SDK services and temporary state roots. |
| Optional live smoke | No | One operator's local provider/model/profile setup can run end-to-end in their chosen repo. Failure diagnoses that setup; it must not fail CI or PR validation. | Start `gjc mcp-serve coordinator` with local env, dispatch a tiny task, then report/read evidence. |

A public bot integration change should at least preserve the contract smoke and local-leak docs test. Live smokes are diagnostics, not mandatory gates.

## MCP tool contract

Read-only tools:

- `gjc_coordinator_list_sessions`
- `gjc_coordinator_read_status`
- `gjc_coordinator_read_tail`
- `gjc_coordinator_read_turn`
- `gjc_coordinator_await_turn`
- `gjc_coordinator_list_questions`
- `gjc_coordinator_list_artifacts`
- `gjc_coordinator_read_artifact`
- `gjc_coordinator_read_coordination_status`
- `gjc_coordinator_watch_events`
- `gjc_coordinator_read_codex_handoff` — reads the Codex app-server resume bridge registration and durable wake state; endpoints are unix sockets or loopback TCP only. Public handoffs report only whether a token is configured, never its path. Token files are independently authorized under `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_CODEX_TOKEN_ROOT` (default: the coordinator state root's managed `codex-tokens` directory), must be owner-only (`0600` or stricter), regular non-symlink files owned by the coordinator user, 1–4096 bytes, and contain neither CR nor LF. The coordinator binds the canonical no-follow file identity at registration and rejects replacement at delivery. Returned wake events expose lifecycle schema version 1 (`pending` → `requested`, `published` → `delivered`, `acked` → `acknowledged`, `failed` → `failed`); durable `attempts` and `last_error` are its failure/retry metadata. Heartbeats are unsupported (`automation_update_unavailable`), so delivery remains event-driven with startup drain.

Mutating tools:

- `gjc_coordinator_start_session`
- `gjc_coordinator_retire_start_session` — retires a stranded start intent only after exact indexed terminal-uncertain session proof; it never signals a live process.
- `gjc_coordinator_activate_session`
- `gjc_coordinator_register_session`
- `gjc_coordinator_send_prompt`
- `gjc_coordinator_submit_question_answer`
- `gjc_coordinator_report_status`
- `gjc_coordinator_stop_session`
- `gjc_coordinator_register_codex_handoff` — registers the Codex app-server resume bridge with a unix/loopback endpoint and an independently authorized token-file reference only; raw token material and paths outside the configured token root are rejected.
- `gjc_coordinator_ack_codex_handoff` — acknowledges a Codex resume wake by durable `wake_key`; wake prompts never include GJC final responses.

`gjc_coordinator_stop_session` closes a coordinator-created (ephemeral) session through canonical SDK broker lifecycle control, then removes its coordinator metadata only after the broker reports success. Newly created `gjc_coordinator_start_session` sessions and fresh sessions created by `gjc_delegate_*` are ephemeral; existing recovered snapshots, reused sessions, and user-registered sessions retain their persisted ownership. The stop path refuses sessions with an active turn. User-registered sessions require both `force: true` and the `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_FORCE_STOP` capability; the same SDK lifecycle path reaps abandoned ephemeral sessions after the configured idle TTL.

`gjc_coordinator_retire_start_session` is the recovery terminal for a
`gjc_coordinator_start_session` receipt stranded in `in_progress` after an
unobserved compensation. It requires the original creation key and request
digest plus the indexed session identity. The broker must prove the recorded
host is exited, the endpoint is absent, and any lifecycle leftovers are
identity-bound before the coordinator receipt is sealed as `retired`.

High-level delegation tools:

- `gjc_delegate_plan`
- `gjc_delegate_execute`

The `gjc_delegate_*` tools package common GJC workflows for hosts that want to delegate an entire planning or execution turn without manually composing `start_session` and `send_prompt`. The retired Team-specific delegation and RPC lifecycle interfaces have been removed. They use the same coordinator mutation gates and workdir allowlists as the lower-level session tools.

### Start a managed GJC session

Call `gjc_coordinator_start_session` with a canonical workdir inside `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_WORKDIR_ROOTS`:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/path/to/repo",
  "prompt": "Optional first bounded task prompt",
  "idempotency_key": "start-gjc-demo-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

The returned payload includes `session.session_id`, `session_state`, and, when a prompt is provided, `turn_id`, `active_turn_id`, `status`, `delivery`, `queued`, and `delivered`. The top-level `status`, `queued`, and `delivered` exactly mirror the nested durable turn; `active_turn_id` is the current active turn.

### Adopt an existing chat thread (prepare → bind → activate)

A stock session publishes readiness immediately, so a running chat daemon surfaces it and creates its own root thread before an operator could name an existing one. To adopt an existing thread instead, start the session *prepared*:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/path/to/repo",
  "prepare_existing_thread": true,
  "idempotency_key": "prepare-gjc-demo-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

A prepared session is live and endpoint-addressable but withholds its readiness signal, so no root is claimed. The response carries `session_id` and `state: "prepared"`, and `session_state.ready_for_input` is `false`. `prepare_existing_thread` refuses an initial `prompt`, and `gjc_coordinator_send_prompt` refuses the session with `session_not_activated` until it is activated.

Preparation requires a configured, session-enabled Slack target in the selected workdir. Slack owns the existing-thread presentation mapping, while `SessionRouter` supplies exact endpoint-generation proof and performs activation without exposing endpoint credentials. Without that combined authority the start fails closed with a lifecycle startup failure instead of returning a prepared session that could activate before any thread is bound.

Bind the existing thread through the daemon-owned command path, which is the only writer of chat mappings:

```sh
gjc notify bind-thread --session-id <session_id> --thread-ts <root_ts>
```

Then activate the session so it publishes the readiness it withheld:

```json
{
  "session_id": "<session_id>",
  "idempotency_key": "activate-gjc-demo-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

`gjc_coordinator_activate_session` proves the exact endpoint generation and asks the session itself to activate; the session's own gate refuses activation with `not_bound` while no binding exists at that generation. It is idempotent: an exact replay answers `already` without a second readiness signal, and durable state moves from `prepared` to `ready_for_input` only after the session proves `activated` or `already`.

### Register an SDK-discoverable session

Register an already-running GJC session only after its endpoint is discoverable from the selected workdir:

```json
{
  "session_id": "visible-gjc-1",
  "cwd": "/path/to/repo",
  "idempotency_key": "register-visible-gjc-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

`gjc_coordinator_register_session` validates the session id and workdir allowlist, verifies SDK endpoint discovery, and only re-registers a runtime that already has the persisted sidecar authority required for authenticated updates. Use `gjc_coordinator_start_session` for a new runtime. Optional `tmux_session` and `tmux_target` fields are advisory process metadata only.

### Send work as turns

Send one bounded task prompt and persist the returned `turn_id`:

```json
{
  "session_id": "gjc-demo",
  "prompt": "Use /skill:ralplan to build a plan for ...",
  "idempotency_key": "send-gjc-demo-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

A session may have one active turn by default. A second prompt returns `active_turn_exists` unless the bot passes:

- `queue: true` to enqueue a durable follow-up turn, or
- `force: true` to supersede the previous active turn and audit the supersession.

### Wait or watch for completion

Use `gjc_coordinator_watch_events` as the primary lifecycle loop. Persist and resume with `next_after_seq`, not `latest_seq`: `latest_seq` is the snapshot watermark, while a filtered or limited page can intentionally return `next_after_seq < latest_seq`. A zero-time watch performs one bounded immediate reconcile/export pass; a positive `timeout_ms` is a bounded long poll. Handle metadata-only `turn.waiting_for_answer`, `question.opened`, `turn.completed`, and `turn.failed` events, and read details through `gjc_coordinator_read_turn` or `gjc_coordinator_list_questions`.

```json
{
  "after_seq": 0,
  "timeout_ms": 30000,
  "limit": 100
}
```

A cursor ahead of the snapshot returns `reason: "cursor_ahead"` with `snapshot_watermark`; reconcile from that watermark according to your retention policy. Malformed or fractional cursors return the public `invalid_input` error. `gjc_coordinator_read_turn` and `gjc_coordinator_await_turn` remain available for snapshots and bounded compatibility waits. Terminal turn statuses are `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `superseded`; non-terminal statuses include `queued`, `delivering`, `active`, `waiting_for_answer`, and `completing`.

`gjc_coordinator_report_status` is optional additive controller-authored evidence. Use it when the bot has an explicit summary/evidence record, needs to record policy cancellation, or must provide a fallback provider/tool failure. Runtime-derived watch events do not require a preceding report. The report idempotency key is crash-recoverable: retrying an identical request after a disconnect repairs canonical projections and retained event delivery before replaying the committed report response without creating another report. The durable receipt/canonical report is consulted before mutable evidence paths are revalidated, so an evidence file may be deleted or renamed after commit without breaking an identical replay. When used, this writes the final response/error, evidence paths, and coordinator report that later reads consume:

```json
{
  "session_id": "gjc-demo",
  "turn_id": "turn-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Implemented the requested fix and ran focused tests.",
  "evidence_paths": ["/path/to/repo/test-output.txt"],
  "idempotency_key": "report-gjc-demo-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

Use `status: "failed"` plus `blocker` for provider failures, unrecoverable tool failures, missing credentials, policy denial, or task blockers.
Use `status: "cancelled"` when the coordinator policy intentionally stops tracking an active turn, for example after an operator abort or a bot-side shutdown decision. This records the turn as terminal in coordinator state; it does not kill or control any tmux process. To supersede one active turn with replacement work, send the replacement prompt with `force: true` and preserve the superseded turn id in your audit trail.

### Forward finish/stop lifecycle notifications

Discord, Hermes, Clawhip, and similar external notifiers should be opt-in and should forward only the public lifecycle surface. Use one of these supported paths:

- Coordinator controllers: watch `gjc_coordinator_watch_events` first, persist `next_after_seq`, and notify from the metadata-only `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, `turn.waiting_for_answer`, or `question.opened` events. Read details through the existing authorized tools; use `gjc_coordinator_report_status` only for optional controller-authored evidence, cancellation, or fallback reporting.
- In-process extensions or hooks: subscribe to the public lifecycle events `turn_end` and `agent_end` from the shared hook/extension event contract.

Recommended notification mapping:

| Notification intent | Public surface | Safe meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turn finished | `turn_end` or terminal coordinator turn status `completed` | One LLM turn produced its final assistant message. |
| Agent stopped / finished | `agent_end` | The agent loop ended for the submitted prompt. |
| Waiting for user | Public `turn.waiting_for_answer` or `question.opened` event | The agent is blocked on a structured question. |
| Failed or blocked | Public `turn.failed` event, with optional controller `report_status` evidence | The runtime or controller recorded a terminal failure. |
| Cancelled / superseded | Coordinator status `cancelled` or `superseded` | The controller intentionally stopped tracking or replaced the turn. |

Do not forward raw prompts, transcripts, tool outputs, hidden instructions, private configs, host paths, channel ids, webhook URLs, or tokens. If your notifier needs a human-readable sentence, create a caller-supplied sanitized summary and keep provider/tool details out of the payload.

Example public-safe extension event payloads:

```json
{ "type": "turn_end", "turnIndex": 2, "summary": "Turn finished; review the local GJC session for details." }
```

```json
{ "type": "agent_end", "summary": "Agent loop ended; no raw transcript is included." }
```

Example opt-in forwarding policy:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "events": ["turn_end", "agent_end"],
  "destination": "external-notifier-profile",
  "redaction": "metadata-only"
}
```

GJC does not currently expose a structured stop-reason field on `agent_end`; integrators that need `waiting_for_answer`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `superseded` should prefer the Coordinator MCP turn status because it is explicit, terminal-state oriented, and safe to relay after controller-side redaction.

### Answer structured questions

Pull questions for one required session; every call reconciles durable pending `workflow.gates.list` rows before returning a bounded `questions`, `diagnostics`, and `reconciliation` snapshot. Filter `status: "pending"`; legacy `status: "open"` remains a compatibility alias for pending. A session can return multiple questions, so handle every pending row independently. The public rows include only the safe question shape, a versioned per-question `answer_schema`, and a per-pending-row `answer_binding`; they never expose private gate payloads or gate values. In coordination-status snapshots, inspect each session's `question_snapshots[].reconciliation` and `diagnostics`; when `summary.questions_complete` is false, `summary.questions` and `summary.open_questions` are `null` and must not be treated as zero.

```json
{ "session_id": "gjc-demo", "status": "pending" }
```

Submit the exact identifiers and binding from one pending row. Validate `answer` against that row's versioned `answer_schema`; the supported union uses public option ids (`opt_0`, etc.):

```json
{ "answer": { "selected": ["opt_0"] } }
{ "answer": { "selected": ["opt_0", "opt_2"] } }
{ "answer": { "selected": [], "other": true, "custom": "A different approach" } }
{ "answer": { "action": "clarify", "question": "What does this option change?" } }
```

A selected answer may contain multiple ids only when the row has `multi: true`; an empty selected answer without `other` is valid only when `allow_empty: true`. The `other` form requires zero selected ids and non-empty `custom`. Both `custom` and clarification `question` strings must contain at least one non-whitespace character, at most 4096 Unicode code points (`maxLength`), and at most 4096 UTF-8 bytes (`x-maxUtf8Bytes`). Controllers must enforce both advertised bounds; the explicit byte-limit extension matches runtime validation for multibyte text.

```json
{
  "session_id": "gjc-demo",
  "turn_id": "turn-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "question_id": "question-1",
  "answer_binding": "<binding returned by list_questions>",
  "answer": { "selected": ["opt_0"] },
  "idempotency_key": "answer-gjc-demo-1",
  "allow_mutation": true
}
```

`gjc_coordinator_submit_question_answer` requires `session_id`, `turn_id`, `question_id`, `answer_binding`, `answer`, `idempotency_key`, and `allow_mutation: true`; it resolves through `workflow.gate_answer`, never generic `ask.answer`. It revalidates against a complete fresh snapshot after restart and before resolution. Incomplete reconciliation returns `terminal_uncertain`; stale, terminal, absent, or ownership-mismatched rows are not answerable. Retry only an identical request with the same idempotency key: it replays the accepted result; reusing that key with conflicting arguments returns `idempotency_conflict`. Always answer the advertised shape; do not synthesize destructive approvals unless bot policy permits them.

This Coordinator MCP pull loop is separate from #2549/#2551 and unattended plain-CLI behavior; those paths do not gain coordinator gate access.

### Read artifacts and reports

Use `gjc_coordinator_list_artifacts` to inspect safe roots and `gjc_coordinator_read_artifact` to read a bounded artifact:

```json
{ "path": "/path/to/repo/.gjc/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl" }
```

Artifact reads are Linux-only because they require identity-bound handle authorization; on macOS and Windows the tool returns the generic `artifact_unavailable` error; detect support through `tools/list` rather than invocation errors. Controllers on those platforms must use their own approved repository/worktree access for artifact collection, then submit bounded paths or summaries with `gjc_coordinator_report_status`. Linux artifact paths are canonicalized, symlink escapes are rejected, and output is byte-capped. Use `gjc_coordinator_read_coordination_status` for status reports written through `gjc_coordinator_report_status`.

## Managed SDK attachment integration

Bots must attach through a managed SDK-core adapter backed by `SessionRouter`. Do not read `.gjc/state/sdk` endpoint records, retain URL/token credentials, or open raw per-session WebSockets. `SessionRouter` owns endpoint resolution, credentials, replay, reconnect, rotation, and exact opaque attachment authority; provider code owns only transport and presentation state.

Use the Telegram, Discord, or Slack managed adapter for a single live session. Use Coordinator MCP for multi-session orchestration, artifacts, status, and durable workflow-gate operations. Lifecycle mutations always enter `SessionLifecycleService` and the Broker ledger with a stable idempotency identity.
The `@gajae-code/coding-agent` runtime and `@gajae-code/natives` native addon ship from the same source release at exact matching package versions; the native loader version sentinel enforces the pair. Mixed native/runtime versions are unsupported and cannot claim SDK compatibility.

Key SDK workflow-gate facts:
- `gjc sdk session raw control|query|global` resolves through `SessionRouter` or the lifecycle facade and emits credential-free JSON. Scripts never receive the underlying transport credentials.

- `action_needed.id` is an opaque, transient presentation ID. It is the only
  generic `reply.id` authority. Do not equate it with a durable workflow gate.
- A durable workflow-gate presentation optionally includes additive SDK v3 `workflowGateId`. It correlates to Q12's durable `gate_id` only within `(sessionId, workflowGateId)` on the current Router-issued attachment; it never authorizes generic reply.
- `workflow.gate_answer` and `workflow.plan_approve` use the durable `gate_id`. `expectedSessionId` omission remains accepted and audited for the entire SDK v3 line so deployed v3 clients continue to work, but new clients must send it. Mandatory enforcement or removal may occur no earlier than SDK v4 and only after at least one full published deprecation release/window with deployed-client notice. A supplied session mismatch is rejected before resolution.
- One session has one active answerable presentation. Additional Q12 gates stay queued while Q12 exposes durable pending records and additive SDK v3 diagnostics. Router replay retains the active action ID; a process restart quarantines old records and a rebuilt workflow remints fresh gate and presentation IDs.
- A native generic reply claim wins a direct-control race once acquired; a direct control wins only by atomically retiring the exact unclaimed active presentation. Terminal, stale, and reissued action IDs never regain authority. Do not use text, option/order, durable-ID, or history heuristics, and fail closed rather than guess when identity is unsafe or ambiguous. Do not persist private route/claim/receipt/epoch/generation state.
- Rust/N-API compatibility is additive: legacy `ActionNeeded`, `register_ask`,
  and `registerAsk` stay uncorrelated; explicit workflow reader/registration
  APIs preserve correlation without exposing private arbitration state.
- The `@gajae-code/coding-agent` runtime and `@gajae-code/natives` native addon ship from the same source release at exact matching package versions; the native loader version sentinel enforces the pair. Mixed native/runtime versions are unsupported and cannot claim SDK compatibility.

The prior documented invariant `action_needed.id == gate_id` is incorrect for
v3 and must not be implemented by controllers. See [the SDK session CLI guide](./sdk-session-cli.md)
for broker-bound controls and [the SDK guide](./sdk.md) for Router and lifecycle
ownership. `--mode rpc`, `--mode rpc-ui`, and `--mode bridge` have been removed
and have no compatibility shim; migrate controllers to Coordinator MCP,
`gjc sdk session`, or a managed Telegram, Discord, or Slack adapter.

## Error handling playbook

| Situation | Bot behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `coordinator_mutation_class_disabled:*` | Re-render setup with the required mutation class, or keep the bot in read-only mode. |
| `coordinator_mutation_call_not_allowed:*` | Add `allow_mutation: true` only after policy approval for that specific call. |
| `unknown_session` | Re-list sessions through the Broker, then start a new managed session or report a recoverable blocker. |
| `active_turn_exists` | Poll the active turn, send with `queue: true`, or use `force: true` only when supersession is intentional. |
| `timeout` from `await_turn` | Treat as non-terminal. Poll again or inspect `read_status`; do not mark failure solely from a bounded wait timeout. |
| Coordinator cancellation | Use `gjc_coordinator_report_status` with `status: "cancelled"` for an intentionally stopped turn, or send replacement work with `force: true` when supersession is policy-approved. This is coordinator state, not process control. |
| Stale session state | Check `read_status.session_state` and broker-backed session status. Report a recoverable blocker rather than inspecting endpoint state. |
| Provider/auth failure | Optionally capture the model/provider error in `report_status` with `status: "failed"`; watch `turn.failed` and do not retry forever without a policy budget. |
| Artifact denied | On Linux, keep the artifact inside allowlisted roots and avoid symlink escapes. On macOS/Windows, use the controller's approved repository/worktree reader and report the bounded result instead. |
| Malformed or invalid question answer | Re-read the question/gate schema and submit a value matching the advertised shape. |
| Bot shutdown | Persist `session_id` and active `turn_id`; on restart use `read_turn` and `read_status` before sending more work. |

## Controller examples

Generic MCP controller config:

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "gjc_coordinator": {
      "command": "gjc",
      "args": ["mcp-serve", "coordinator"],
      "env": {
        "GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_WORKDIR_ROOTS": "/home/bot/src/project:/home/bot/src/worktrees",
        "GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_MUTATIONS": "sessions,questions,reports",
        "GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_PROFILE": "controller-prod",
        "GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_REPO": "project",
        "GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_SESSION_COMMAND": "gjc --worktree"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Example controller loop:

```text
1. Start `gjc mcp-serve coordinator` with repo/worktree roots allowlisted.
2. Call `gjc_coordinator_start_session` for a GJC-managed worktree session.
3. Send `/skill:deep-interview`, `/skill:ralplan`, or an approved `gjc ultragoal ...` task as one turn.
4. Await the turn; answer `gjc_coordinator_list_questions` entries using bot policy.
5. Report terminal status with evidence paths.
6. Read artifacts/reports for the user-facing bot response.
```

Hermes and OpenClaw can use the same MCP tool contract. Their names here are examples of controller products, not privileged integration modes.

## Long-running prompts are progress-aware

`sdk.promptDeadlineMs` (default `3_600_000` ms) is an inactivity lease, not a fixed wall-clock kill. The SDK renews the accepted prompt's terminal deadline from attributable `tool_execution_start` / `tool_execution_update` / `tool_execution_end` events for the exact `commandId`/`turnId`, bounded by `sdk.promptMaxRuntimeMs` (default `21_600_000` ms, max `86_400_000`). A running tool's partial-result `tool_execution_update` counts, so a long-running tool that streams output keeps the lease alive mid-run. Persist `session_id` / `turn_id` from the accepted prompt and reconcile via `turn.result` (Q26) or `gjc sdk session status` rather than replaying blindly. Heartbeats, assistant text/thinking chatter, retries, and other-turn activity do not extend the lease. Distinguish `timeout_ms` on `await_turn` / coordinator await from the SDK terminal deadline.

## Security and credential boundaries

- Do not put provider API keys, GitHub tokens, or bot secrets in prompts.
- Prefer host tools, host URI schemes, or bot-side sidecars for credentialed external writes.
- Keep `GJC_COORDINATOR_MCP_WORKDIR_ROOTS` narrow; do not allow `/`, `/home`, or broad parent directories.
- Use namespaces for multi-tenant bots.
- Keep mutation classes minimal: read-only for dashboards, `sessions` for work dispatch, `questions` for answering questions, and `reports` for final state.
- Treat `.gjc/` as local runtime state and evidence. Do not expose it wholesale to untrusted users.
