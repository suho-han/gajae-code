# Skills

GJC supports custom `SKILL.md` skills that live as plain files on disk, following
the same file convention as Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. Filesystem skill
discovery is **on by default** — a valid skill placed in a canonical `.gjc`
location is advertised in a normal session (listed in the session's `<skills>`
catalog and invokable via `/skill:<name>`) with no configuration ceremony.

The four bundled GJC workflow skills — `autoresearch`, `deep-interview`, `ralplan`, and
`ultragoal` — are always available and can never be replaced by a filesystem
skill with the same name.

## Canonical locations (loaded directly)

Project scope (trusted from the repository you open):

| Location | Scope notes |
|---|---|
| `<project>/.gjc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Native GJC location; discovered from every ancestor of `cwd` up to the repo root (closest first) |

A trusted Git repository may share its project skills through a root symlink:

```text
<project>/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
<project>/.gjc/skills -> ../.agents/skills
```

The `.gjc/skills` entry remains the explicit runtime authority: `.agents/skills` is
not independently auto-loaded. The link must resolve to a directory inside the same
repository. Discovery, management listing, and skill invocation share this policy.
The repository, link, and resolved target identities are checked during scanning and
again when loading the body; replacing a captured link or target invalidates that
discovery result. Dangling links, external targets, hardlinked skill files, and
non-regular files are not admitted.

This exception does not apply to user/profile roots, custom directories, or repositories
without a verified Git root. Native skill creation/import writes still refuse symlinked
destination roots; manage the shared source files directly rather than replacing the
project link with a copy.

User scope (installed once, available in every project):

| Location | Scope notes |
|---|---|
| `~/.gjc/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Canonical GJC user location |
| `<config>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Configured legacy root (`<config>` is the home-relative directory from `GJC_CONFIG_DIR`, then `PI_CONFIG_DIR`, then `.gjc`) |
| `~/.gjc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Historical legacy user location (still honored) |

## Claude Code / Codex layouts (explicit import sources)

GJC recognizes the Claude Code and Codex skill layouts but never loads them
directly — `.gjc` is the only runtime authority, so a session never silently
executes content owned by another host's configuration:

| Location | Convention |
|---|---|
| `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Claude Code project skills |
| `<project>/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | OpenAI Codex project skills |
| `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Claude Code user skills |
| `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Codex user skills |

These are **import sources**: the `skill_discovery` tool and
`gjc skills discover` surface them as diagnostics naming the exact copy command
that enables each skill, so a skill placed in a documented convention location
is discoverable in a normal session. Foreign user-home layouts are enumerated
for import only and are never loaded into sessions.

Importing is a plain file copy into a canonical location:

```sh
# import one Claude Code project skill into the current repository
mkdir -p .gjc/skills/my-skill
cp .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md .gjc/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# import one Codex user skill into your user-wide GJC skills
mkdir -p ~/.gjc/agent/skills/my-skill
cp ~/.codex/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md ~/.gjc/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

## Installing a skill

Copy a skill directory (its `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter that
includes `name` and `description`):

```sh
# project-local, per repository
mkdir -p .gjc/skills/my-skill
cp my-skill/SKILL.md .gjc/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# user-wide, available in every project
mkdir -p ~/.gjc/agent/skills/my-skill
cp my-skill/SKILL.md ~/.gjc/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

Start a new session and invoke the skill with `/skill:my-skill`, or let the
model discover it with the `skill_discovery` tool.

## Trust and disable

Skill discovery is controlled by three settings, all on by default:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `skills.enabled` | Master switch for all filesystem skill discovery |
| `skills.trustProjectSkills` | Load project-scoped `.gjc/skills` and surface project `.claude`/`.codex` import candidates |
| `skills.trustUserSkills` | Load user-scoped skills (`~/.gjc/agent/skills` and legacy roots) and surface user-home import candidates |

```sh
gjc config set skills.trustProjectSkills false   # ignore repo-controlled skills only
gjc config set skills.trustUserSkills false      # ignore personal skills only
gjc config set skills.enabled false              # disable all filesystem skill discovery
```

The deprecated `skills.enablePiProject` / `skills.enablePiUser` settings remain
supported as aliases: an explicitly configured legacy value is honored unless
the corresponding trust setting is also configured. `gjc config set` accepts
either name.

Bundled workflow skills are never affected by these switches — they remain
available even with discovery fully disabled.

## Precedence

Duplicate names resolve deterministically, first location wins:

1. project scope beats user scope;
2. within project scope, the `.gjc/skills` directory nearest to `cwd` wins
   (ancestors are walked from `cwd` up to the repo root, closest first);
3. within user scope: `<config>/agent/skills` > legacy `<config>/skills` >
   legacy `~/.gjc/skills`.

Shadowed duplicates are diagnosed rather than silent. Bundled workflow skill
names are reserved: a project skill named `autoresearch`, `deep-interview`, `ralplan`,
or `ultragoal` produces a protected-name collision warning, and the bundled
definition always wins in sessions.

## Diagnostics

Invalid skills and policy filters produce actionable diagnostics instead of
silent skips:

- a `SKILL.md` without a leading YAML frontmatter block;
- a skill without a `description` in its frontmatter;
- a skill shadowed by a higher-precedence location;
- a skill filtered by `skills.ignoredSkills` / `skills.includeSkills` /
  `disabledExtensions`;
- a protected-name collision with a bundled workflow skill;
- a Claude Code / Codex import candidate (with the copy command that enables it);
- disabled discovery scopes (the `skill_discovery` tool returns a `notice`
  explaining which setting blocked an otherwise-empty result).

Inspect what is discoverable and why from the CLI:

```sh
gjc skills discover                # project + user skills with diagnostics
gjc skills discover --source project --json
gjc skills discover --query ego-browser      # filter by name/description/source/use conditions
gjc skills discover --limit 10               # clamped to 1-50; the CLI defaults to 50
gjc skills discover --offset 50              # zero-based start of the page
```

Discovery pages are stateless: when more skills match than fit on one page, the
diagnostics name the shown range and the total, and the text output prints the
exact `--offset` command for the next page (with your `--limit`/`--query`/`--source`
echoed back). The final page prints no continuation; in `--json` that is the
absent `nextOffset` field, alongside `matching` (skills left after the query
filter) and `scanned` (skills the filter ran against).

## Custom directories

`skills.customDirectories` adds extra user-scope scan roots; tilde expansion is
supported. Skills loaded from custom directories follow the same filters
(include/ignore/disabled) as discovered skills.
